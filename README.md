# AI-Store
###Overview
This project was my personal project for Harrisburg University Project 2 course. I developed an AI model using TensorFlow that can access a camera and detect and recognize some common foods that you would find in the grocery store and display relevant data about it such has pricing and nutritional tips. This was made to act as prototype with possible real-world applications.
